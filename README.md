# Solar Radiation Data Analysis 
"This project aims to analyze solar radiation data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo to help MoonLight Energy Solutions identify high-potential regions for solar installation." 
"## Objectives" 
"- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on solar radiation data." 
"- Visualize relationships between solar radiation, wind, temperature, and other environmental factors." 
"- Clean and preprocess the data for further analysis and modeling." 
"## Folder Structure" 
"- `src/`: Contains main Python code for analysis." 
"- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis." 
"- `tests/`: Contains unit tests." 
"- `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts."
